# Forecasting Volume and Revenue with Machine Learning

This repository contains scripts for forecasting daily volume and revenue based on weather data using machine learning. The workflow involves loading and preprocessing data, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and volume forecasting. 

## Repository Structure

- `Load & Preprocess data.py`: Script to load raw data, preprocess it, and save the cleaned data.
- `Model training.py`: Script to train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
- `Model evaluation.py`: Script to evaluate the trained machine learning model.
- `Volume Forecasting.py`: Script to forecast daily volume and revenue using the trained model and weather data.

## Workflow

### 1. Load and Preprocess Data

**Script**: `Load & Preprocess data.py`

**Purpose**: Load raw data from an Excel file, preprocess it (convert date columns to datetime format), and save the cleaned data to another Excel file.

**Steps**:
- Load data from `Data.xlsx`.
- Convert the 'date' column to datetime format.
- Save the preprocessed data to `Preprocessed_Data.xlsx`.

**Sample Usage**:
```bash
python "Load & Preprocess data.py"
